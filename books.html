					<h2>"HTML 5 Foundations"</h2>
					<small>Author: Matt West</small>
					<img src="img/html5-100.jpg" alt"cover of HTML5 Foundation book">
				</div>
				<p>After having a blast with teamtreehouse.com service I decided to see if their books are as good as 
				   the online service.Book is printed on really good quality paper and it's quite colorfull as well.
				   It's a amazing book for beginners explaining all the fundamentals needed to build a static website.
				   You will learn all html5 tags and learn how to use them.</p>
				<p>It even covers advanced HTML5 technologies like Geolocation and Canvas and explaining basics of Javascript. 
			   	   Obviously author is not going in to the details, so if you would like to learn these properly you should
				   look somwhere else. </p>
				<p>Overall it's a great book to start learning web development.
				   Teaching you all the basics you will need and making you ready to learn more advanced technologies.</p>

				</div>
				<p>If you looking to learn css3 properly don't look any furder.
				   Like "HTML5 Foundation" from treehouse series, book is beatifully printed wich makes reading a really enjoyable experience.
				   In more than 300 pages author managed to go trough all important concepts of Css3.</p>
				<p>There is a whole chapter introduncing you to selectors and shows how to use them.
				   Everything is explained while creating project that will eventaully become a fully featured web page.
				   Topics include media queries, cross-browser combatibility etc.</p>
				<p>It's a fantastic book written in a easy language.Definitly worth reading.</p>

					<h2>"Head First : Javascript programming"</h2>
					<small>Author: Eric T. Freeman, Elisabeth Robson</small>
					<img src="img/headfirst.gif" alt="cover of head First javascript book">
				</div>
				<p>Great book to start learning, especialy if javascript is your first language.
				   It explaines all the fundamental knowledge, that will make your life easier once you
				   move deaper to more advanced topics.</p>
				<p>Clearly explains concepts like first class functions, scope, closures and prototypes.
				   You will learn basics of DOM, how it's structured and how to get elements, how to use events.
				   By the end of the book you will be armed with some handy js tricks and you will crave to learn 
				   more.Thats probably the gratest thing about this book- it will make you want to learn more.</p>
				<p>After each chapter authors throws you some excercaises,
				   making sure that you understood what you just read.
				   Some of them are really cool, in one of the chapters you will build battleships game.
				   It's a easy read ,and  really enjoyable wich is quite of achivment for authors.
				   They managed to teach and entertain the readers at the same time.
				   So if you just starting I highly recommend "Head First : Javascript programming".
				   You won't be dissapointed.</p>
